## What Makes This Game Innovative?

**üöÄ Revolutionary Game Design:**

1. **Self-Sustaining Content Ecosystem**: Each defense submission automatically generates a new Reddit post for community voting, creating an infinite content loop where players become both creators and consumers. This approach turns the entire community into active content generators, ensuring fresh material and sustained engagement without requiring external content creation.

2. **Seamless Reddit Integration**: Runs entirely within Reddit posts using Devvit's web platform with zero external dependencies. The game creates a native Reddit experience with automatic user authentication, post creation, and community integration that requires no additional accounts, downloads, or external websites.

3. **Intelligent Post Type Detection**: The game automatically detects whether users are accessing the main Daily Docket post or a specific jury voting post, seamlessly routing them to the appropriate interface via the `useGame` hook with different initialization flows (`InitResponse` vs `JuryVotingInitResponse`).

4. **Real-Time Social Voting Drama**: Live vote updates every 2 seconds via `useRealTimeUpdates` hook with clean Scales of Justice display showing current verdict, comprehensive connection status indicators (üü¢ connected, üü° connecting, üî¥ error, ‚ö´ disconnected), and seamless data synchronization.

5. **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Scrollable single-column layout optimized for Reddit's predominantly mobile user base, with fixed bottom voting buttons for easy access while reviewing case details, zero horizontal scrolling required, and touch-friendly controls throughout.

6. **Enhanced Character System**: Dedicated character sections for "THE JURY" (representing the player with jury imagery) and "THE ACCUSED" (unique prisoner mugshots selected deterministically based on case ID), creating clear visual storytelling and defined courtroom roles.

7. **Comprehensive Accessibility**: Full WCAG compliance with screen reader support, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, semantic HTML structure, skip links, and mobile accessibility features throughout all components.

8. **Audio Integration**: Web Audio API implementation with synthesized courtroom gavel sound effects via `AudioManager` class, animated bounce effects on voting buttons, and graceful visual fallback handling ("üî® GAVEL!" overlay) for audio-restricted environments.
